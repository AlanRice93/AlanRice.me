            Hello, Iâ€™m a developer living in
            <span class="line-through text-green-500">San Francisco</span>
            New York. Most of my experience is in feature development at smaller companes. I have a special interesting in 
            tooling that helps improve the developer experience. Long-term I'd love to use this knowledge to help lead happy and efficient 
            engineering teams. 
            <br />
            <br />
            Outside of programming I'm a passionate investor, mostly following the agressive growth stock methods of Bill O'Neill. I'm also a former musician, and still am excited about all things music and drumming.
            <br />
            <br />
            I'm not currently looking to switch roles, but feel free to shoot me an email if you'd like to chat more.
