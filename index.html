            Hello, Iâ€™m a developer living in
            <span class="line-through text-green-500">San Francisco</span>
            New York. Most of my experience is in feature development at smaller companies. I have a special interest in 
            improving developer experience so that everyone is happier and more efficient. My long-term goal is to be the best 
            engineering manager possible. Outside of programming I'm an avid stock investor (mostly CANSLIM) and was previously a professional musician (jazz drummer). 
            <br />
            <br />
            I'm not currently looking to switch roles, but feel free to shoot me an email if you'd like to chat more.
