			Hello, Iâ€™m a developer living in
			<span class="line-through text-green-500">San Francisco</span>
			New York. Most of my experience is in feature development at smaller
			companies.
			<br />
			<br />
			I have a special interest in exploring the latest tools that make the
			developer experience easier. I hope to use the knowledge to one day lead
			efficient, happy engineering teams.
			<br />
			<br />
			Outside of programming I'm an avid stock investor, mostly in the agressive
			growth style of Bill O'Neill. I'm also a former jazz drummer and still
			passionate about all things music.
			<br />
			<br />
			I'm not currently looking to switch roles, but feel free to shoot me an
			email if you'd like to chat more.
