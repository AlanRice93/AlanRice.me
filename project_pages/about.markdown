Alan's journey into programming started differently than most. An artist all of his life, Alan found passion while painting and playing music. While a jazz student (drums) at NYU, Alan's roommate showed him a game he was building in Java. Alan was fascinated with never-ending possibilities  web development afforded creatives. Alan soon gained enough proficiency to enroll in NYU comp-sci courses.

After graduating from NYU, Alan was accepted into General Assembly's 12-week Web Development Course. At GA Alan learned the in's and outs of RESTful design, APIs, and MVP structure. The program had a broad reach and included Rails, Sinatra, Node, Mongo, and SQL to name a few.

Alan gained real-world experience as a 12-week full-time intern at Oak Studios. At Oak, Alan contributed to projects used by thousands and was pushed to write clearer, more efficient code that was easily understood. The Oak team showed Alan how integrity, passion, and a perfectionist-level of detail produces outstanding work. This was the biggest step in Alan's education.

Alan draws inspiration from his many hobbies. He still devotes a large portion of his time to studying all aspects of music and can be seen playing drums frequently in NYC venues. Alan is also a fitness fanatic, doing CrossFit daily and constantly exploring new schools of yoga. Alan is so well-versed in film that his friends constantly play betting games to see how many movies he can directly quote.
