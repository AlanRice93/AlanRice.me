CreativeMornings is a breakfast lecture series provided for creatives all around the planet. Oak designed, developed, and maintains their online experience, which handles over 3000 videos in 15 languages and a custom administrative site.

CreativeMornings threw a competition and wanted Oak to take their designs and build them into a website. As an intern, I was tasked with bringing CreativeMornings PSDs to life and to interpret them to be fully responsive.

Creating the site was an education in detail-driven design. I got great feedback from the Oak team and was pushed to measure each pixel to make sure my design maintained the integrity of the original PSDs. I also learned a ton about maintaining the essence of a design while it shifts through different sized devices. Working so hard on this project changed the way I look at websites and all design in general.
