CreativeMornings is a breakfast lecture series provided for creatives all around the planet. Oak developed and designed their huge online experience, which handles over 3000 vidoes in 15 languages and a custom administrative site.

I was given the task of developing a site for CreativeMornings for a freelancer competition they were hosting. I used Oak's own SiteLeaf CMS to allow CM admins to alter content as they wished, and working on this site was a huge education in the importance of choosing the right CMS for a client.

The project also taught me a great deal about detail-oriented design. Through the feed-back from the Oak team, I learned to identify specific padding, font-spacing, and other crucial details that I previously didn't consciously notice. I came out of building this website with a completely new outlook on what constitutes great design. Since the PSDs were static, I also learned a great deal about maintaining the intergrity of a design as the size of the browser changes between devices.
