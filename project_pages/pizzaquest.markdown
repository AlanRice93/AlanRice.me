Working on PizzaQuest was one of the most fun projects at General Assembly. The curriculum at GA rightly places a lot of importance on version-control and collaboration, which was great preparation for my internship. PizzaQuest was the result of a group effort of 4 members.

The app turned out to be much more developed than we originally thought possible. We used the Google Maps API and HTML5's geo-location to locate users and perform a search for all pizza-related restaurants within a 10 miles radius.

Once we accomplished the MVP, we moved on to create a social aspect to the app where users could check-in at locations, write reviews, and comment on other users's check-ins and reviews. Users with the most reviews would be placed onto a leaderboard.

This project was my first experience working on a code-base with more than one other person. Because my group took the time to have daily stand-ups and took version-control seriously, we were able to delegate work efficiently and help each-other with problems.
