PizzaQuest was the result of a group effort at General Assembly. At GA, we had daily stand-ups with the entire class as a training for being on a development team. For the group project we got to put these skills along with version control to make a collaborative project.

 We used the Google Maps API and HTML5's geo-location to locate users and perform a search for all pizza-related restaurants within a 10 miles radius. Due in part to our organization and luck, we finished the MVP a while before the deadline, and therefore developed some extra social features. We made users have the ability to comment on each others's posts and included a leaderboard where users could compare all of their scores.

This project marked the first time I really collaborated on the same-code base with a group of people. The project cemented how useful good communication and clear-code can be when working with others. Our method of tracking issues and daily stand-ups really helped push the project forward at a great pace. Most importantly, everyone was able to creatively contribute to the project and felt that their voices were heard.
