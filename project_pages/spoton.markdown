SpotOn was my final project at General Assembly. I was really excited to work on this project as I got to combine my passion for music with data-visualization. I loved the concept of writing everything in Javascript, so I decided to use the MEAN stack (Mongo, Express, Angular, Node) and D3.js for the visuals.

As a musician, I know that automated music-recommendations are usually less than stellar. With SpotOn I wanted to take a shot at making a more interactive and visual recommendation experience. Using the Spotify API and D3.js, the app uses node-based graphs to show related-artists based off what the user types in.

The project really forced me to consider how to store data (specifically all of the arrays of related artists), and how to sort through them efficiently. The project was also a step forward in user-driven design for me, for example creating an auto-complete when the user types in artist. SpotOn showed me that I could bring my unique background into development and create something unique.
