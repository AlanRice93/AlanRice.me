SpotOn was my final project at General Assembly. I was really excited to work on this project as I got to combine my passion for music with data-visualization. I loved the concept of writing everything in Javascript, so I decided to use the MEAN stack (Mongo, Express, Angular, Node) and D3.js for the visuals.

The projects goal was to tackle the problem of finding new bands to enjoy. Often music-recommendations are pigeon-holed to specific genres, which doesn't allow someone with diverse musical interests to really discover new music.

I set out to build an app that'd allow users to input any artist they wanted and have D3.js visually represent 20 related artists (using Spotify's API). The user could then type in an infinite more amount of artists, and if artists shared any mutual 'similar artists', D3 would draw a link between them.

The project really forced me to consider how to store data (specifically all of the arrays of related artists), and how to sort through them efficiently. I also learned a great deal about Javascripts threading. The code isn't perfect (especially the Angular) but it was a great introduction into the Mean Stack.
