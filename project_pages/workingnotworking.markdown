'Working Not Working' is an invite-only community of the world's top creatives that companies like Facebook, Google, and the New York Times use to hire talent. Oak developed WNW's online presence and provides ongoing maintenance as well as develops new features.

While interning at Oak I tackled different UI and functionality issues provided by WNW on Github. Many of these were UI issues that were fixed with a mix of Sass and Javascript. I also developed new payment options of users using Stripe that WNW wanted to implement.

It was great working on a project that thousands of people use everyday. Since WNW is touched by many different developers, it was a great opportunity to write clear, articulated code others could understand and manipluate if they so wished. WNW also included tons of different Gems that I got to learn, including InfiniteScroll, Will-Paginate, and Isotope. This was the most robust Rails app I had worked on at the time and it was a real eye-opener into what Rails is capable of.
