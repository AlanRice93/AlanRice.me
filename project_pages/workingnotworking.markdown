'Working Not Working' is an invite-only community of the world's top creatives that companies like Facebook, Google, and the New York Times use to hire talent. Oak developed WNW's online presence and provides ongoing maintenance and develops new features for the site.

While interning at Oak I tackled different UI issues that were provided by WNW. I also developer new features to the site, for example allowing managers to re-post jobs and to received emails when their posts expired.   

It was a great experience to work on a site that's used by thousands of daily users and is worked on by many different developers. It was a unique challenge to write clear, articulated code that others could read and adapt down the road. WNW also included tons of different Gems that I got to learn, including InfiniteScroll, Will-Paginate, and Isotope. Working on the site gave me a huge education on navigating huge, long-standing projects and writing code that could explain itself.
