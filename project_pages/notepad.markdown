NotePad was a rails project that I built to simulate Twitter. It was an interesting experience combining Backbone and Rails, two technologies I'd never used in conjunction. Using Backbone was a huge revelation for me from a UI standpoint, as it was the first time I saw that JS can allow you to manipulate content without refreshing the page.

NotePad also taught me the core concepts behind building CRUD functionality. I wanted users to be able to do any of the main action they're used to doing on other sites, including editing posts (or canceling an edit). NotePad marked a shift in my thought process where, through the CRUD system, I started designing any code I wrote around the end-user's experience.

Sometime down the road I want to add a lot more to NotePad. The first major step would be to make the social part of the app come together. I want users to be able to friend each other, follow each other, comment and like each-others posts, etc.
