NotePad was a rails project that I built to simulate Twitter. It was an interesting experience combining Backbone and Rails, two technologies I'd never used in conjunction. Using Backbone was a huge revelation for me from a UI standpoint, as it was the first time I saw that JS can allow you to manipulate content without refreshing the page.

NotePad also taught me the core concepts behind building CRUD functionality, and the specific cases where it can be tricky. I wanted users to be able to edit posts, and getting the edit functionality and UI to be clear to users was a unique challenge.

In the future I want to develop the app to have a stronger social element. As of now, users see other posts from random users, but I'd like to developer a follower system, where content is tailored depending on who a user follows.
